## Privacy

This tool runs entirely in your browser. There is no server. No data is uploaded, no telemetry, no analytics. Thumbnail files come straight from YouTube's image servers (i.ytimg.com) to your browser.

## Framework / hosting

- Static HTML / CSS / JS deployed via GitHub Pages from this repo's `main` branch.
- UI chrome is the published `crusher-ui-kit` static contract; the pinned version and its SRI hashes are managed fleet-wide by `tools-hub/scripts/bump-kit.mjs`.

## Development

- Open `index.html` directly in a browser. No build, no dependencies.
- Or serve the parent workspace via the hub's preview server: `cd ../../tools-hub && npm run preview` then visit `http://127.0.0.1:8723/utility-tools/youtube-thumbnail-downloader/`.
